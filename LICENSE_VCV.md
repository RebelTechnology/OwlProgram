All copyright holders (i.e. contributers) have agreed to transfer copyright for the code in `LibSource` and `Source` to Martin Klang, for the purpose of dual licensing both these subdirectories. The original `GPL-v3-or-later` license still holds, but the source code has also been made permissable for use in VCV closed source and premium plugins, e.g. Befaco Oneiroi project.

Contributers (and therefore original copyright holders) are listed below:

* Martin Klang / mars / pingdynasty 
* Giulio Moro / giuliomoro 
* Stanislav Shtin / antisvin
* Damian Quartz / ddf
* Ewan Hemingway / hemmer
